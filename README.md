# nimfuzz
Simple and compact Nim fuzzing library based on the great 
[fauxfactory](https://github.com/omaciel/fauxfactory). 
The primary purpose of the library is to generate random strings to test the 
security of common utilities to help defend your system.

Most of the module is self-explanatory, and you can look through the Nim-
generated docs to see the available functions.

See docs [here](https://apense.github.io/nimfuzz).
